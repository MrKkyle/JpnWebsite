# JpnWebsite
This Website features my understanding of HTML/CSS/PHP using information about Japan.

To operate this program two things are needed:

(1)XAMPP has to be installed and and index.php file has to point to the project(namely the login.html)

(2)The user has to obtain the login credentials to proceed to the main portion of JpnWebsite.
In the event that the user is unable to obtain the login credentials to login, here is a work-around:

Using (1):
â†’Point the index.php to the MyWebsite.html page instead of login.html . THis will sucessfully bypass the need to use credentials.
